                Space Research Organisation, where he
                was project director of the SLV-III, the
                first satellite launch vehicle that was
                both designed and produced in India.
                <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                    “Missile Man.”</strong>
                <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
                was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range

                the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                solidified India as a nuclear power and
                established Kalam as a national hero,
                although the tests caused great concern
                in the international community.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put
                forward a countrywide plan called

                a less-developed to a developed society
                in 20 years. The plan called for, among

                productivity, emphasizing technology as
                a vehicle for economic growth, and
